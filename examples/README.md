# Examples and Tutorials

In this directory, we include a few notebooks to show how to use the framework built in this project. 

In its current form, it includes the following three notebooks:
* [mcts.ipynb](./mcts.ipynb)
* [mcts_vs_mcc.ipynb](./mcts_vs_mcc.ipynb)
* [mcts_vs_others.ipynb](./mcts_vs_others.ipynb)

Future improvements could be made by thoroughly explaining how to use every functionality of the implementation.
